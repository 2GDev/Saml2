@model AssertionModel
<p>
    This form will allow you to send a SAML2 Response to a service provider.
    If the In Response To ID field is empty, the Response is considered unsolicited (IDP initiated).
</p>
<p>
    The SAML messages sent by the Stub Idp will be signed with <em>@Html.ActionLink("this certificate", "Certificate")</em>.
    To validate the responses you need to download it and configure your service provider to trust it. 
    <em>Caution</em>: Never trust this certificate in a production environment as it will allow anyone to sign in to 
    your application as whatever user they choose.
</p>
<p>
    Please fill in the required fields.
