Welcome to Sustainsys.Saml2
===========================
The Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites, allowing the web site 
to act as a SAML2 Service Provider (SP). The library was previously named Kentor.AuthServices.
Sustainsys.Saml2 is open sourced and contributions are welcome, please see contributing guidelines 
for info on coding standards etc.

Using Sustainsys.Saml2
----------------------
Using the Sustainsys.Saml2 library to add SAML2P support into your ASP.NET web applications is a two-step process:

#. Reference the Nuget package
#. Provide the necessary configuration information

The exact nature of these steps depends on the ASP.NET integration you're after.  
See :doc:`getting-started` for all the details.
